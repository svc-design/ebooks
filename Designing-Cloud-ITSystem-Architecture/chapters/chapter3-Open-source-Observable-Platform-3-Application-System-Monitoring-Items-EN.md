# Overview

Utilizing open-source monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Alertmanager, Loki, and Grafana for monitoring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of infrastructure and application resource consumption. This approach also involves unifying the handling of monitoring metrics, logs, and link tracing, as well as reducing ineffective alerts. Below is a solution concept and configuration example based on the S.T.A.R. (Situation, Task, Action, Result) methodology:

## Situation

The organization requires monitoring of infrastructure and application resource consumption.

There is a need to unify the handling of monitoring metrics, logs, and link tracing, as well as the alert system.

## Task

To implement comprehensive monitoring of infrastructure and applications.

To reduce ineffective alerts while ensuring SLOs are met.

## Action

**Prometheus and Alertmanager Configuration:**

- Utilize Prometheus for monitoring infrastructure and application metrics.
- Manage alerts with Alertmanager, configuring rules to match specific metric anomalies.

**Loki Configuration:**

- Collect and manage log data.
- Write queries using LogQL and integrate with Grafana for log display.

**Grafana Configuration:**

- Add data sources from Prometheus and Loki to Grafana.
- Create dashboards for visualizing metrics and logs.
- Utilize Grafana's alerting features for improved alert management.

**Link Tracing:**

- Integrate an appropriate link tracing system (such as Jaeger).
- Ensure link data is combined with Prometheus and Grafana.

**Alert Optimization:**

- Analyze historical alert data to identify and adjust frequent and ineffective alerts.
- Refine alert conditions using PromQL and other query languages.

## Result

- Achieved comprehensive monitoring of infrastructure and applications.
- Effectively reduced ineffective alerts, enhancing operational efficiency.
- Improved system stability and reliability.

When monitoring non-relational databases (such as MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, etc.), it is essential to pay special attention to their unique architectures and usage patterns. This includes monitoring the health of distributed clusters, data replication status, and responses to specific access patterns. This supplementary entry covers the primary monitoring aspects of non-relational databases, ensuring their high performance and reliability.
